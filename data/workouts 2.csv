There was a lot of mud (let's say 5 miles of mud per lap) what sucked a lot of my energy and cramped a lot but I feel they were related on how tired I was after pedaling in mud. Had a lot of hand pain, to the point that there were occasions I wasn't able to shift. I let the race to take over and started too fast, with a race peak HR of 170. A lot to learn and fix on this, if you have experience or know someone that do, I think we might need to ask some questions, I don't think regular riding is going to be enough to have a good Leadville* *04/03/2018 Tara Strassburg: I totally agree!

From what I can see, your average HR for those intervals was around 165-168. The top of your Z3 would be your max average HR minus 5 beats, which would be 163. Your actual HR at the top of Z3 is 165, so I choose to keep it there and not lower it. Power looks to be around 300ish Watts, which I can adjust in TP. I don’t think this will make much difference, as a majority of your training in the aerobic zones is HR based. What this will affect is your speed intervals - those targets are now higher, and of course, race pacing and expectations!*","2.71805143356323","6.15199995040894","","70","","130","175","","","0.72532599168217","162.42","70","15","16","20","23","19","","","","","89","3","12","11","24","27","","","","","",""
