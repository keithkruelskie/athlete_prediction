Right before you do the test, weigh yourself with no clothes on and with whatever food you plan to eat during the test. Do not include any fluids you right drink. Use a digital scale and record the weight. Ride one hour at your 40K ITT bike race effort (minus 8 beats) or at your half ironman bike effort by power or heart rate (around Z3). If you do a warmup before, then follow number 1 before you start the test. Immediately after the hour test, dry yourself off, and then weigh yourself with no clothes on and with whatever food you weighed in with at the beginning of the test but didn’t consume. Submit the following: Weight in pounds with at least tenths included for before and after the exact amount of fluid in ounce that you consumed the weather/temperature Based on your fluid losses, a fluid plan will be developed for each race distance. Based on your lean body weight, your carbohydrate intake will also be calculated. Please answer the following What is your current body fat percentage? Guesstimate if unsure or I can recommend a cheap caliper set to buy/use off Amazon. Do you typically experience cramping or other dehydration symptoms during races?

Nice level of workouts. Feel like I could use a little more top end on running/biking but I see some of that is coming. Feeling like swimming is light. My form is there for swimming but aerobic capacity is definitely dipping. On the plus side I am feeling leaner and lighter... . 2) Health/Restoration: How many hours of sleep have you been getting the last few nights and how is the quality of your sleep? 7-8 hours most nights Are you stretching? Stretch after every workout. Foam roll maybe 2x a week. Do you have any sniffles/sore throat/cough/abnormal fatigue, etc? No Do you have any problem areas, muscularly or otherwise? Just a toenail with blood under it, and a medium size blister on my big toe. Neither of which impact my biking or running form . 3) Nutrition, how has your nutrition been the last few days? Pretty spot on except for the beer What was your morning weight? . 4) Life/Balance: How has your life-balance of work/school/family/play/stress/etc been this last week? Triathlon is my main focus outside of work, balanced well with my girlfriend and socializing! . 5) Mental/Emotional: how ya feeling in general? Anything affecting your training or racing that I should be aware of? Feeling great. A bit of FOMO about skiing on good powder days but my choice is to work towards Ironman Boulder!","0.0833333333333333","","2018-02-26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
