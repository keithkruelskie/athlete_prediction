### Problem Statement:
Modern race predictions for endurance athletes are often built on simple pace calculations, extrapolating race paces from a single point in time without incorporating training load and environmental factors. I aim to use machine learning on real world amateur athlete data to not only improve race prediction accuracy, but also provide feedback to the athlete about how to improve and be successful in their racing endeavours.
